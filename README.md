String Reversal: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Palindrome Check: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Count Vowels: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Count Words: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the count of words in the sentence.

String Concatenation: Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns their concatenation.

Character Frequency: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary with the frequency of each character in the string.

Remove Duplicate Characters: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with duplicate characters removed.

String Rotation: Write a function that takes two strings as input and checks if one string is a rotation of the other (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").

Anagram Check: Write a function that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

Substring Count: Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring in the string.

String Compression: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a compressed version of the string where repeated characters are replaced with the character followed by its count (e.g., "aabcccccaaa" becomes "a2b1c5a3").

Title Case Conversion: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and converts it to title case (the first letter of each word is capitalized).

CamelCase Conversion: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and converts it to CamelCase (remove spaces and capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one).

String Palindrome Permutation: Write a function that takes a string as input and checks if any permutation of the string could be a palindrome.

Longest Common Prefix: Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest common prefix among them.
